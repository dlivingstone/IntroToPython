    "Python is now one of the world's most popular programming languages - not just for teaching introductory programming, but for a wide range of web applications, data analytics, scientific programming and more. As such, there is no shortage of helpful resources for learning programming in Python. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [The Python website](http://python.org/) - The main Python website is a great resource to know about as you start to learn more.\n",
    "- [Introduction to Python](http://introtopython.org/) - The introduction to python course that these lectures are built on\n",
    "- [Python for Developers](http://ricardoduarte.github.io/python-for-developers/). This also uses Jupyter Notebooks, allowing you to try all the code online. Part 1 covers all of the features you'll need for this course (except for PyGame). The other parts of this course cover some very advanced programming features and concepts - as the name implies, this resource is aimed at professional developers.\n",
    "- There are also a wide range of free online courses at e.g. Coursera, EdX and FutureLearn. As a GSA student you also have access to the tutorials at Lynda.com, e.g. [https://www.lynda.com/Python-training-tutorials/415-0.html]"

    "Learning Programming\n",
    "---\n",
    "Learning programming requires very active engagement in learning - it is not enough to just attend lectures, read notes, books, etc. - You need to try out programs, explore them and try to understand how they work, and you need to write your own programs. Initially there may be a lot of 'hacking', trial-and-error editing of code just to see what works. Over time, as you understand things better, you will find that you understand better what is required for any particular problem - and you'll continue to make mistakes and continue to learn from them!\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming is also not so much about learning a particular programming language - but about learning how to solve problems, using particular approaches to break down large problems into smaller problems and be able to determine the sequences of steps required to solve these smaller problems. This is sometimes termed \"computational thinking\" - and is a problem solving approach that can be used to solve problems in the physical as well as the digital world.\n",
    "\n",
    "But the basic advice can be summarised as this: Write programs. Start by writing small and simple programs, and as you learn start working on larger and more complex programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are looking for problems to solve that start fairly simple but become more complex, you could look at e.g. this list of programming problems [https://adriann.github.io/programming_problems.html]. Another list of problems that are all maths based can be found at Project Euler [https://projecteuler.net/] - while the first few of these are fairly straightforward, they rapidly become quite complex."
