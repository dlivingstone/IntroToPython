A collection of IPython Notebooks for teaching Python.
---
Amended by Daniel Livingstone for teaching use, 2018

This project a derivative of of [introtopython.org](http://introtopython.org), an open resource for teaching and learning Python. The site teaches the basics of Python, and then teaches people to build projects in Python. If you know how to work with IPython notebooks, you can contribute to the project.

You can also view the original raw notebooks using the IPython Notebook Viewer ([home page](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.github.com/ehmatthes/intro_programming/master/notebooks/index.ipynb). The content is almost identical on both sites, but the [introtopython.org](http://introtopython.org) version is easier to navigate, and has some dynamic js features such as collapsible output.

More information on the original project is available in README-ORIGINAL (https://github.com/dlivingstone/IntroToPython/blob/master/README-ORIGINAL.md)
